Regulation of enzyme activity can capture changes in enviromental conditions
Regulation of what enzymes are in the cell allows for slow adaptation to changes in environmental conditions
A metabolic pathway consists of several enzymes, so maybe consider including different enzymes: varying k_cat.
consider adding enzyme inhibitors to check that things are not getting uncontroledo
model extracellular enzymes to reflect the transport of substrates in the surroundings, their acquisition, and transport across the membrane for subsequ3ent intracellular metabolism.

Fix a realistic interval for chemical potentials in order to calculate reasonable Keq!

The smallest the gibbs energy change corresponds to the reaction m_0 --> m_1, because only m_0 is present at the beggining. Sometimes, that energy change is greater than 4 DeltaG ATP, so no reaction is possible. 
The reaction network stops being generated when the last metabolite is produced. This means that only one arrow will arrive to the last metabolite, and never more. I don't know how realistic is this.

I have found out that the reaction networks I am creating are actually very similar between each other. Come up with a different way, so that it is acually more varied.
Another problem I have found is the Keqs. Sometimes they are too big, and sometimes they are too small. I don't know how to keep them at a normal level, because I choose my reactions according to the 4 Delta G limit, and I still obtain huge amounts!!
I need to find a way to deal with big Keqs when calculating rates. Sometimes they yield nans, and that isn't cool.

Make sure that concentrations are always positive!

Going back to work after exams: what the hell is total reactions?

May 22,2020

Maybe qualitatively different reaction networks give different dynamics. Is it worth studying the effect of reaction network type in the ecosystem dynamics
What is the deal with the eta matrix? how do you choose it?
I transform negative elements to 0, I hope that is okay if the timestep is small enough right?
