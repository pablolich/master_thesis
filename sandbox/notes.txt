Regulation of enzyme activity can capture changes in enviromental conditions
Regulation of what enzymes are in the cell allows for slow adaptation to changes in environmental conditions
A metabolic pathway consists of several enzymes, so maybe consider including different enzymes: varying k_cat.
consider adding enzyme inhibitors to check that things are not getting uncontroledo
model extracellular enzymes to reflect the transport of substrates in the surroundings, their acquisition, and transport across the membrane for subsequ3ent intracellular metabolism.

Fix a realistic interval for chemical potentials in order to calculate reasonable Keq!

The smallest the gibbs energy change corresponds to the reaction m_0 --> m_1, because only m_0 is present at the beggining. Sometimes, that energy change is greater than 4 DeltaG ATP, so no reaction is possible. 
The reaction network stops being generated when the last metabolite is produced. This means that only one arrow will arrive to the last metabolite, and never more. I don't know how realistic is this.
