Regulation of enzyme activity can capture changes in enviromental conditions
Regulation of what enzymes are in the cell allows for slow adaptation to changes in environmental conditions
A metabolic pathway consists of several enzymes, so maybe consider including different enzymes: varying k_cat.
consider adding enzyme inhibitors to check that things are not getting uncontroledo
model extracellular enzymes to reflect the transport of substrates in the surroundings, their acquisition, and transport across the membrane for subsequ3ent intracellular metabolism.
