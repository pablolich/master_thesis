Regulation of enzyme activity can capture changes in enviromental conditions
Regulation of what enzymes are in the cell allows for slow adaptation to changes in environmental conditions
A metabolic pathway consists of several enzymes, so maybe consider including different enzymes: varying k_cat.
consider adding enzyme inhibitors to check that things are not getting uncontroledo
model extracellular enzymes to reflect the transport of substrates in the surroundings, their acquisition, and transport across the membrane for subsequ3ent intracellular metabolism.

Fix a realistic interval for chemical potentials in order to calculate reasonable Keq!

The smallest the gibbs energy change corresponds to the reaction m_0 --> m_1, because only m_0 is present at the beggining. Sometimes, that energy change is greater than 4 DeltaG ATP, so no reaction is possible. 
The reaction network stops being generated when the last metabolite is produced. This means that only one arrow will arrive to the last metabolite, and never more. I don't know how realistic is this.

I have found out that the reaction networks I am creating are actually very similar between each other. Come up with a different way, so that it is acually more varied.
Another problem I have found is the Keqs. Sometimes they are too big, and sometimes they are too small. I don't know how to keep them at a normal level, because I choose my reactions according to the 4 Delta G limit, and I still obtain huge amounts!!
I need to find a way to deal with big Keqs when calculating rates. Sometimes they yield nans, and that isn't cool.

Make sure that concentrations are always positive!

Tue May 19 13:48:56 CEST 2020

Going back to work after exams: what the hell is total reactions?

May 22,2020

Maybe qualitatively different reaction networks give different dynamics. Is it worth studying the effect of reaction network type in the ecosystem dynamics
What is the deal with the eta matrix? how do you choose it?
I transform negative elements to 0, I hope that is okay if the timestep is small enough right?

May 25,2020

Maybe I am able to vectorize the loop trhough all strains... 
How do I choose the number of reactions happening?

May 26,2020

Change supply and dilution rates accordingly so that substrate concentrations don't diverge?
I can store the intake - output that a certain community has and plot it against the final richness
I can also store the rate at which the population decreases for each strain (asymptotically)
Group selection??
Introduce a new population in the remanents of an old one; population ingeneering...j
How does the number of reactions affect the performance?
Analytical work with this model?


May 28,2020

Less reactions more energetic == More reactions less energetic (only in terms of energy)
The deal with negative concentrations. Precision errors can turn low concentrations to negative ones. If this happens, the population will decrease, in the next time step, decreasing the demand of the metabolite with low concentration. As a result of this, in the following time step that concentration will increase. This yields oscillatory stable dynamics.
In order to avoid oscilations, one could try to set negative concentrations to 0. However, the population (and the metabolites produced by its metabolism) diverges oscillatorily. This is caused because a concentration of 0 lowers the population a bit, but not as much as the mathematically obtained negative concentration would. This is why in the next step, the supply of metabolite will increase the population more than it was decreased in the previous step, by a 0-metabolite concentration that should have been negative.Consequently, the population increases monotonously.

I can create a function to assign probabilities to each integer by binning what is around int, and use it to directly sample integers normally distributed. This allows me to draw integers with replacement.

Jun 02,2020

It looks like forcing microbes to be generalists (varied pathways) generates higher richnes. In the model, generalists are favored over specialists. Is this realistic?
First I have to take advantage of full power of the model, to then start doing other treatments. I have to find values for constants, etc...

Representing individual performance versus actual performance in the community yields a very mild positive correlation, which is what we would expect. The line x = y is an upper limit of this plot. This means that no species in the community performs better than by itself. 
It would be nice to plot this points with varying size depending on how many members the community has.

Jun 06,2020

Plot the total reaction network of surviving species
Vary the type of reaction network that each species can have
Implement a more efficient individual performance calculator.

Jun 06,2020

Simulate a lot of stuf for different reaction number and try to plot the phase transition from f being predictive to it not being predictive at all.
I found out that mean individual performance is a good prpedictor when communities have low richness. I interpret this as the winning species being able to outperform in all circumstances. This is not the interesting regime (its also not the realistic one). We are looking for communities which structure is shaped by interactions between community members.

Jun 07,2020

Investigate the influence of temperature in community persistence??
Characterize how are the reaction networks of species that survive in communities where individual performance is not a predictor of community structure. Maybe that is where the Lyapunov function numerical equivalent can be found. 

Investigate why for large m, s, num_reac, n_simul, the individual integration stops at some point.

Profile code to see why is it slow for high number of metabolites (even when the reaction number is small)

Jun 08,2020

Generate boxed reaction networks (niche formation)
I found that winning species don't have networks that systematically are able to harvest more energy. If I calculate the mean energy harvested by these species, according to their reaction networks, this one is of the same order as the energy harvested by the loosing species. 
If I impose a tradeoff in the costs, things get caotic as fuck. I no longer have less resources when more species... I no longer have a positive correlation for low richnesses... It is fucked uuup. Time to investigate reaction networks.
It is so different, that sometimes the slope of the line is >> 1. Even when there are many points. 
When I plot individual performance of all organisms vs the community performance, I find a weak stripped pattern. This indicates that organisms in the same strip share something. I want to investigate what is this that they share. I will start by histogramming the individual performances to identify the strips (high frequencybins should correspond to the strips). When I identify this communities, I should plot the individual reaction network of this guys.
I have plotted the community network for all communities and there is no apparent pattern. This makes sense because neither specialists nor generalists win. Try not using Tikhonov's costs, what are the community networks in this case?
The length of prediction$stable.states is less than the length of surv_networks. Investigate why. Maybe clean up code.
Checked that if I have a fixed cost, dynamics are dominated by generalists

Jun 09,2020

When plotting the community reaction networks, I find that the lower part of the matrix is always coloured, indicating that individuals that have reactions involving the lower metabolites are more popular. I think this is because the reactions proceed in only one direction. Thus, there will be a net flow of metabolite and the last metabolites will be produced more abundantly. Therefore, strains possesing reaction that involve the last metabolite will be favored. This doesn't seem very realistic. To avoid it, I can impose a gradient of energy in the metabolites, so that even if you have reactions in the lower part of metabolite space, you are not favored by its big abundance.

I want to investigate 4 main questons: 
	1. Have repeated and continuous coalescence events contributed to the high microbial diversity in some habitats, such as the soil?
	2. Do 'hybrid' communities exhibit a broader functional range and higher productivity compared with communities entering a coalescence event?
	3. Will members of communities with a history of coalescence have a higher persistence upon interaction with a 'naive' community?
	4. Can we predict properties of coalescent communities using approaches derived from the study of interacting networks?

Can I treat a community network as an organism?

Calculate how the networks varies with time. Particularly, record the modularity of the network over time.
Also can track how the 'individual' modularity of both networks varies with time, and how the 'total' modularity of the resulting network varies with time. I would do this to try to find temporal coherence before they fully merge. This coherence would suggest that these communities interact as internally integrateed units rather than just as a collection of many species that sudenly interact with another collection of species. The species replacement in a coalescent process of this type occurs within these newly  interacting integrated units rather than a more stochastic rearrangement of interactions within the entire new network. This type of network dynamic is an emergent property of the whole network, which arises from the fact that components of local communities can in some cases act as whle units with strong intersactions within these units and weak interactions between. 

I could include in the costs, reactions that are very energetic, so that you don't really get to do that because it costs so much.
On the previous note, I wonder how could I include randomness in the costs in a justified manner. Right now the randomness in the costs comes from the reaction network, which is not random at all! There are a fixed number of different reaction networks. The apparent randomness stems from the fact that the number of strains in a simulation is very small compared to the number of strains that can exist. I shall keep it like that and come back to it later.

Jun 10,2020

What I want to do this week: Start performing community coalescence events and record candidates to community fitnesss on the way. inbetweeness, in-degree, out-degree.

Check why my analysis.R script is failing to plot all communities!!

Can I make my reaction network generator a faster one?


Jun 16,2020

So currently, when I randomly choose 5 species (ie, pick a reaction network with N_reac = unif(1, 45), and bring the system to equilibrium, generalists remain at equilibrium more frequently than specialists. Since the best equilibrium is that reached when all resources are depleted simultaneously most efficiently, to beat a generalist we need many specialists that cover the same niche breadth. The problem is that since I am only sampling 5 species, it is very unlikely to draw 5 specialists. This problem can be solved in two ways:
	If he pool of competing species is complete (I include in the system all the posible reaction networks), in which case, since I am not including randomness at any point (all reaction network have been sampled), the solution is unique, and no preference would be given to generalists over specialists. However, this seems computationally fucked up
	If I limit, like you did, the number of reaction networks to a very low one. However, this seems unjustified.

Plan for this week: 
	1. Implement a measure of individual fitness based on the initial growth rate
	2. Calculat F numerically as sum_i log(R_i/T_i)
	3. Calculate cohesion of a community.
	4. Calculate the total flux (degree) of the network

Step 2 is completed. I verified that the quantity F is minimized under the given dynamics.

Before going into steps 3 and 4, I am going to program the coalescent communities. 

Depending on the power of the tradeoff in my  cost model I get different number of reaction networks at equilibrium. 

Tomorrow, I need to adress: why are some F still 0? How are those communities?

Jun 17,2020

I have programed the coalescent communities. I find that for one pair of communities, one goes extinct and the other one survives. This is a phenomenon that I would not be surprised to find in most of the communitiy coalescences. 

I neet to investigate the F's still, and calculate the total flux (degree) of the network, and workout the units.
Make one community coalesce, iteratively, and record F. See if it increases
What about the correlations??
What measures of cohesion do we have?
