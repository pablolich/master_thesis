1. What models is the package fitting?
2. Is the package just fitting or also calculating starting values?
3. Is the package doing model selection/averaging?
	I would like to do model averaging. I have to put all models under the same parameters.
	Maybe do taylor expansions or other kind of approximations to get a certain feature of the curve in terms of parameters of each model, and from there, get the parameter representing that feature, which is common for all models, and do model averaging on it. This adds generality and therefore allows for inclusion of more models or modification of existing ones. There is no need to hardcode analytical expressions specific for each model.
4. Is the package providing plots?
5. Literature reading. 
	Introduction to TCP as a general concept, not just applied to growth rates
6. What are the changes with respect to the python package of the guy?
